# Economic Recession Forecasting Project

## Overview
This project is dedicated to forecasting economic recessions by analyzing GDP percentage points through the use of SARIMA and Hidden Markov Chain Model (HMM). 
The goal is to accurately predict downturns in the U.S. economy on a quarterly basis.

## Dataset
The dataset `gdp_recession_II.csv` is central to our analysis. It consists of quarterly observations, detailing the percentage points indicative of recession likelihood.
