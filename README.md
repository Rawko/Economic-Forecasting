# Economic Forecasting Repository

## Overview
This repository contains a comprehensive suite of tools and datasets designed for economic forecasting. 
Leveraging advanced statistical models and machine learning algorithms, it not only predicts economic indicators but also extends its applicability to the realms of physics and genetics. 
This interdisciplinary approach enables researchers, economists, policymakers, physicists, and geneticists to make informed decisions based on robust forecast models.

## Features
- **Data Collection**: Scripts to automate the collection of economic, physical, and genetic data from various sources.
- **Preprocessing Tools**: Utilities for cleaning, normalizing, and transforming data to prepare it for analysis.
- **Forecasting Models**: A collection of statistical and machine learning models tailored for economic data, with applications in physics and genetics.
- **Visualization Tools**: Scripts to generate insightful visualizations of economic trends, physical phenomena, and genetic patterns, along with forecast results.
- **Documentation**: Detailed documentation on the methodology, usage, and implementation of each tool within the repository, emphasizing its interdisciplinary utility.

## Getting Started
1. **Clone the Repository**
